INTRODUCTION:
Nowadays the every manual work is done online or web based. Our project is also a web based application namely “General website for NGO” in this project the user will be able to see complete profile of the NGO and they will be able to donate them if they want to we will also include a Google map so that they can see where the NGO  is based it will be a completely dynamic website which can be changed accourding to the needs of NGO we will be using the frame of PHP namely Codeigniter for developing the project.
Our project is also responsive it can be easily used by tablets and mobile phone users.
OBJECTIVES: 
Our aim is to help the people using this project because NGO helps poor people so we should help NGO in order to achive high funds and help more people.  

METHODOLOGY:
As we know that proper development step are the approach of computerization of any system, So we also adopted some prevailing steps to develop this system.

Software selection is very important because it depends upon the problem to be solved and resources of the organization in which the system has to be implemented. The codeigniter is used for the development of the proposed system. codeigniter is extremely powerful we can write PHP code manually and therefore I used PHP because sometimes ready made codeigniter modules do not complete the programmer needs so by custom PHP you can do anything you want.
As we know that during designing we put integrated, user friendly and efficient system as our objective. For the database structure we went for the best solution of normalization. Also for interface we discussed the easy availability of tools of development, and we discussed few web-based interfaces. By the end of this session we were at the stage to use MYSQL database as the backend tool and PHP as the web based interfaces. 


Tools & Techniques: 
PHP Language
Web browsers: Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer
Web browser extensions: Firebug for Firefox, A helper add-on for closer inspection of page structure directly via browser and fire shot.
Image manipulation software:  Photoshop
Database:  My SQL Database
